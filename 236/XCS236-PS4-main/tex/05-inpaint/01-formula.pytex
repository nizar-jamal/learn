\points{5a} \textbf{Inpainting Formula}

Express the inpainting update mathematically, ensuring that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For $m = 0$, the value is taken directly from $x_{\text{orig\_noisy}}$,
    \item For $m = 1$, the value is taken from the noised version of $x_t$.
\end{itemize}

The expression derived here will be implemented in \texttt{apply\_inpainting\_mask} in the next question.
