\points{1c} \textbf{Generalization to Multivariate Gaussian}

Extend the result of part b. to a multivariate Gaussian distribution $p(\bx) = \calN(\bx \mid \boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma})$. 
Derive the expression for the score matching loss for the multivariate case, and explain the challenges posed by the covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ 
in higher dimensions.
